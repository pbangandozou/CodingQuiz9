Weighted Uniform Strings 

Time Complexity: This program has an O(n) time complexity, where n is the string's length. This results from the string's conversion to an array.
the array's iteration, and the queries' comparison with the HashSet, all of which have linear time complexity.

Space Complexity: This program has an O(n) space complexity, where n is the string s' length. 
This is mainly because, in the worst-case scenario when every character is unique, 
both the character array made with toCharArray() and the weights stored in the HashSet require O(n) space.
