Weighted Uniform Strings 

Time Complexity: This program has an O(n) time complexity, because n is the string's length. This is from the string's conversion to an array.
with the comparison with the HashSet, all of which have linear time complexity.

Space Complexity: This program has an O(n) space complexity, where n is the strings length. Mainly because, 
in the worst-case scenario when every character is unique, both the character array and the weights stored in the HashSet require O(n) space.


Mini-Max Sum

Time Complexity: The program has an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input list arr. 
It takes O(n) time to go through every element in the list, While adding, comparing, and subtracting integers are constant-time operations,

Space Complexity: The program has an O(1) space complexity because it makes use of  variables that require constant memory, 
like sum, max, min, minSum, and maxSum O(1).
